What is Routing?

Routing defines the way in which the client requests are handled by the application endpoints.

Implementation of routing in Node.js: There are two ways to implement routing in node.js which are listed below:

1.By Using Framework

2.Without using Framework

Using Framework:
1.Node has many frameworks to help you to get your server up and running. The most popular is Express.js.

2.Routing with Express in Node: Express.js has an “app” object corresponding to HTTP.

We define the routes by using the methods of this “app” object. This app object specifies a callback function, which is called when a request is received.

We have different methods in app object for a different type of request.


For GET request use app.get() method:

var express = require('express')
var app = express()
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
res.send('Hello Sir')
})

For POST request use app.post() method:

var express = require('express')
var app = express()
app.post('/', function(req, res) {
res.send('Hello Sir')
})


For handling all HTTP methods (i.e. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.) use app.all() method:

var express = require('express')
var app = express()
app.all('/', function(req, res) {
console.log('Hello Sir')
next() // Pass the control to the next handler
})
